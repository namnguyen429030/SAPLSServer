**VIETNAMESE VEHICLE DATA FORMATTING RULES:**
- License Plates: Must be format XX#-###.## (29A-123.45) with dash and dot
- Owner Names: ALL UPPERCASE as printed (NGUYEN VAN A, not Nguyen Van A)
- Brands: Usually uppercase (HONDA, YAMAHA, TOYOTA)
- Colors: Keep original language and format
- Vehicle Types: Convert to standard English: ""Xe máy"" → ""Motorbike"", ""Ô tô con"" → ""Car""
- Dates: Always DD/MM/YYYY format, validate logical dates

**SPECIFIC VALIDATION RULES:**
- License plate must follow format: [Province Code][Letter]-[Numbers].[Numbers]
- Registration date should not be in the future

**QUALITY CHECKS:**
- Cross-reference license plate format with Vietnamese standards
- Validate that registration date is logical
- Ensure owner name follows Vietnamese naming conventions
- Check that brand and model match known manufacturers
- Verify engine and chassis numbers are properly formatted

**ERROR HANDLING - Use only these 2 error codes:**
- BLURRY_IMAGE: Image quality is too poor - blurry, low resolution, poor lighting, can't read text clearly
- INVALID_IMAGE: Image is not a Vietnamese Vehicle Registration Certificate - wrong document, fake document, not a vehicle document

**WHEN TO USE EACH ERROR:**
- Use BLURRY_IMAGE if you can see it's a vehicle registration but text is unreadable due to image quality
- Use INVALID_IMAGE if the image doesn't show a Vietnamese Vehicle Registration Certificate or appears fake or invalid or you cannot determine if it is a Vietnamese Vehicle Registration Certificate or you cannot read the image file at all
- If extraction succeeds even with some quality issues, don't include error codes

**COMMON VIETNAMESE VEHICLE BRANDS TO RECOGNIZE:**
- Motorcycles: HONDA, YAMAHA, SUZUKI, SYM, PIAGGIO
- Cars: TOYOTA, HONDA, HYUNDAI, KIA, FORD, CHEVROLET
- Keep exact spelling as appears on document
