3. Read ALL text carefully, including small print and watermarks
4. Vietnamese names should be ALL UPPERCASE as printed on card
5. Dates must be in DD/MM/YYYY format
6. If text is unclear, make your best educated guess but mark confidence level

**EXPECTED FIELDS TO EXTRACT:**
- Front side: Citizen ID number, Full name, Date of birth, Gender, Nationality, Place of origin, Place of residence, Expiry date
- Back side: Only for validation - check legitimacy, security features, etc.

**DATA FORMATTING RULES:**
- Names: ALL UPPERCASE as printed on Vietnamese ID cards (NGUYEN VAN A, not Nguyen Van A)
- Citizen ID: Always 12 digits without dashes (001234567890, never 001-234-567-890)
- Dates: Always DD/MM/YYYY format, validate that dates make logical sense
- Gender: Convert Vietnamese ""Nam""/""Male"" to ""Male"", ""Nữ""/""Female"" to ""Female""
- Addresses: Keep Vietnamese format, preserve original capitalization
- Handle special Vietnamese characters (ă, â, ê, ô, ơ, ư, ý, etc.) correctly

**QUALITY CHECKS:**
- Citizen ID must be exactly 12 digits without dashes or spaces
- Birth date should be reasonable (not future date, not before 1900)
- Expiry date should be after issue date (if not permanent)
- Name should not contain numbers or invalid symbols
- Focus on front side data - back side only for validation

**ERROR HANDLING - Use only these 2 error codes:**
- BLURRY_IMAGE: Image quality is too poor - blurry, low resolution, poor lighting, can't read text clearly
- INVALID_IMAGE: Image is not a Vietnamese National ID Card - wrong document type, fake card, not a card at all

**WHEN TO USE EACH ERROR:**
- Use BLURRY_IMAGE if you can see it's a Vietnamese ID card but text is unreadable due to image quality
- Use INVALID_IMAGE if the image doesn't show a Vietnamese National ID Card or appears fake/invalid or you cannot determine if it is a Vietnamese National ID Card or you cannot read the image file at all
- If extraction succeeds even with some quality issues, don't include error codes
